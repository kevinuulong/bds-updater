    dart pub get
    dart run update.dart --platform="windows" --path="PATH_TO_SERVER"
```

## Note about v2.0.1
v1.0.0 of this script was written for Node.js. I then ran into some strange issues with my installation of Node.js so instead of fixing those issues I rewrote the script using Dart. v1.0.0 is still functional (as of now) and [available on the v1.0.0 branch](https://github.com/kevinuulong/bds-updater/tree/v1.0.0) if you would rather use that version.
